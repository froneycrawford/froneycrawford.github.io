<h2> Welcome </h2> 

Welcome to the senior seminar. In this course you will participate in
the following: 

<ul> 

<li> Practice writing a scientific paper

<li> Learn how to give a scientific presentation

<li> Hear lectures by eminent scientists and interact with them

<li> Learn more about careers available to you when you are finished
at Haverford

<li> Get into contact with alumni who have gone in career directions
of interest to you

<li> Learn about graduate school and how to go about selecting an
applying to schools

<li> Discuss topics relevant to science

</ul>

The class meets on many Wednesdays throughout the semester, but with
several other special events. Copies of all assigned readings in the
course will be made available to you in advance of the class
meeting. You are expected to have read the assignment and to come
prepared to discuss it. A binder in the physics lounge contains
reports on some alumni who were contacted by senior seminarians in
previous years.

<h2> Course Requirements (Fall) </h2>

<ul> 

<li> Attend all scheduled meetings of the seminar, including any added
later. (You will be informed by announcement or email if we add any
sessions.)

<li> Attend Philips visits and department colloquia. We hope you will
also attend the informal meetings with our visitors. They enjoy
talking with students and these informal gatherings are a great way to
find out about the speaker and what he or she is up to.

<li> Read assigned selections and participate in class discussions.

<li> Contact two Haverford physics grads who are in non-academic jobs
(you may include no more than one graduate student), discuss their
careers with them and prepare a one-page report and a brief (5-10
min.) presentation for the rest of the class. Reports will be graded
only on a credit/no credit basis, but hand them in on the date of the
presentations for full credit. Also keep in mind that they will go
into the binder, so following cohorts of physics majors will be
reading them. You should begin the process of selection and contact
well in advance of the presentation date (that is, as soon as possible). 

<li> Write a short paper (4-5 pages) consisting of a preliminary
version of the introduction and background sections of your senior
paper, plus a short (one page) description of your project as a
whole. This is due at the end of the semester and will be the basis of
a brief (10 min.) informal presentation that you will give to the
seminar. 

</ul>




<h2> Grading </h2> 

You will receive one grade at the end of the academic year for PHYS
399 as a whole. (The grade of CIP, course in progress, will be
submitted at the end of the fall semester.) The physics faculty
working together assigns grades in the senior seminar according to the
following weighting factors:

<ul> 
<li> Fall semester short paper (<font color=#FF0000>10%</font>) 
<li> Fall semester oral presentations/class participation (<font color=#FF0000>20%</font>) 
<li> Quality of senior talk (<font color=#FF0000>30%</font>) 
<li> Senior paper (spring semester) (<font color=#FF0000>40%</font>) 
</ul>

A reduction of 0.1 grade points will be applied per unexcused absence
if more than one occurs per semester. (This includes attendance at
required colloquia and talks.)

<h2> Meeting Times and Schedule </h2>                                                                                
Meetings are generally Wed 2:00-3:30 p.m. in Koshland INSC Link
205. However, there are also some additional special events. This
schedule is subject to revision.
