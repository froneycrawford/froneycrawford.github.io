<h2> Course Description </h2>

<ul>

The advertised purpose of this course is to introduce beginning
physical science students to some of the exciting new developmens in
astrophysics. The overall theoretical understanding of many of these
topics can be expessed in terms of fundamental physics at the level of
an introductory course (e.g., Physics 105 and 106), and much of the class will
involve the application of fundamental physical principles to various
astrophysical phenomena. Since the details of these phenomena are
quite complicated, it will be necessary to construct simple models and
make judicious approximations. However, this shouldn't be viewed as a
limitation of the course; in fact, such activities are precisely what
working physicists often do. The picture of physics you may have
acquired so far, i.e., a series of "laws" (and corresponding
equations) and "problems" to be solved with those laws, is usually
very far from the reality of "doing physics." The study of physics is
a never-ending series of constructing models to describe physical
phenomena and then attempting to apply these models to new
situations. Ultimately these models are "wrong" in the sense they
invariably fail to properly describe or predict some new phenomenon
(this was true for Newton's law of gravitation which was surpassed by
Einstein's theory of general relativity, which in turn will have to be
generalized to include quantum mechanics). Therefore, the approach in
this course will, hopefully, give you a better idea of how physics
really works.

<p>

The unity of physics (i.e., the interrelation of different areas of
physics), is also something that is readily apparent in dealing with
complex astrophysical phenomena. This is also a crucial aspect of the
study of physics that is often not emphasized in standard courses (for
understandable reasons). For example, to understand why stars shine,
one needs to invoke thermal and statistical physics, gravitational
physics, hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, nuclear physics, scattering
theory, quantum mechanics, etc. While we will necessarily make gross
simplifications (I assume that you have not yet mastered the above
topics!), you should begin to get a feel for how physicists pursue
such a problem.

<p>

Finally, it is hoped that this course will provide you with insight on
how to go about "solving" quite general physical problems. This is
also not the standard fare in most courses where you are required to
apply restricted techniques to solve a set of restricted problems in,
for example, electrodynamics. Physicists, and astrophysicists in
particular, often choose problems for study not because they involve
applications in a particular branch of physics but rather because they
are inherently interesting (or important). They then use those areas
of physics that are required to solve "the problem." Of course, this
isn't easy, and the present class won't, by any means, make you an
expert in doing it. However, any insight you gain here will
undoubtedly help you in your future study of physics. Among useful
skills are: the ability to look at a complicated problem and "see" the
most important feature of it; the ability to build simple models that
capture the salient features of a problem; the ability to make
approximations; the ability to do simple "back-of-the-envelope"
calculations; and the ability to judge what is a reasonable result,
(i.e., to know when you've made a mistake).

The text, 
<i><a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465036732/qid=1068838430/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/002-0013701-0240051?v=glance&s=books>Just Six 
Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe</a></i> by 
Martin Rees, is not a resource for
achieving the above goals; in fact, it is intended primarily for the
non-technical reader. However, it will provide a backdrop for putting
into context the topics listed below. It also will provide examples of
the inter-relatedness of physics. Finally, it tells a facinating story
of how a few (six) seemingly unrelated quantities have conspired to
allow just the kind of Universe that is required to have such
creatures as us in it. Some of the discussion seems more philosophical
than physical and illustrates Rees's particular take on the
subject.

<h2> Course Format </h2>
                                                                                
<ul>

In addition to the first, introductory and organizational lecture,
there will be seven classes that meet every other Monday evening. A
reading assignment will be given in advance (from Rees, your current
physics text, and from a few web sources). You will be assigned a few
questions and/or problems based on these readings that will be due at
the beginning of class. Each class will begin
with an introductory lecture that, in addition to the readings, will
help set up the topic(s). After a short discussion, there will be a
coffee/cookie break during which there will hopefully be more
discussion. The remainder of the class will be a workshop in which we
will discuss the topic and break up into teams to work on one or two
defining problems. The latter will not be typical textbook problems,
but rather questions like, "What can we deduce about the mass content
of the local universe from the dipole moment in the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation?" and "Why is there a maximum mass of a neutron
star, what is this mass, and what happens when this mass is exceeded?"
These will entail marshalling information from the readings, your
overall knowledge of physics, and your ability to make simplifying
models of the systems; in short: "doing physics." Individuals or pairs
of students may be called on to lead the discussion on particular
topics. One follow-up written question (probably one of the problems
discussed in the workshop) may be assigned to be handed in at the
beginning of the next class. The only exam will be the final that will
be a combination of multiple choice questions and a few, short,
back-of-the-envelope problems. While all of this may sound like a lot
of work for a half-credit course, the readings will not be excessive,
the assignments are short, and the class only meets every other
week. However, because of the workshop nature of the course, class
attendance is <i>mandatory</i>.
