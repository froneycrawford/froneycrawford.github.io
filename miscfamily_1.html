<p>

Here is an excerpt from my grandfather's journal during this trip
outlining his impressions of Germany (remember, 
this was December 1938, less than a year before the start of the war).

<p>

<i>
...From Paris we entrained, with our hearts in our mouths, for the wicked
and lawless Germany - Heidelberg being our first stop. Contrary to all
our expectations we were met and treated with the greatest respect. We
saw the famous University and the old castle at Heidelberg...

<p>

From Heidelberg we traveled to Munich, the historic city in wherein a
European war was averted by a pact between the European powers that
be...It was in this city that the Nazi party was founded, and it
contains the shrine dedicated to the sixteen men who gave their lives
in the famous battle of the Hofbrauhaus...Inasmuch as Munich is the
capital of the movement one has a great many uniformed men. They have
nice-looking uniforms, ranging in type from that of the staid army
officer to the more picturesque Bavarian or Swiss guard type, and
their equipment includes short, vicious-looking daggers and automatic
pistols of high caliber. There are chrome-plated sabers for the
officers and chrome-plated helmets for the guardsmen. All in all they
project a nice appearance, but it is an appearance that commands
respect by virtue of its warlike character...
