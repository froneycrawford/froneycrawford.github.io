Jill and I took a trip to Southern Germany and Austria in
early September 1999. Here are some descriptions and my rankings of the
places we visited. Some pictures are at the bottom.

<h2> Our Itinerary </h2> 

<ul>

Day 1: arrive Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Mainz <br>
Day 2: Wurzburg, Rothenburg (via Romantic Road) <br> 
Day 3: Rothenburg, Munich (via Romantic Road) <br>

Most of the time when we were not on the Romantic Road or in the Black
Forest we traveled on the Autobahn. We rented an Alfa Romeo for the trip,
which was fun to drive.

<h2> Froney's Rankings (in chronological order) </h2>
</center>

<h2>Frankfurt</h2>

This is a large city, but
there are only a few places worth seeing as a tourist. These 
places can be seen on
foot leaving from the main rail station area. 
This is worth part of a day if you
are waiting around before going somewhere else. The city is pretty
easy to navigate by car. <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: B</b>

<p>

<h2>Mainz</h2>

This city lacks charm and is unfortunately 
not even worth a side trip from
Frankfurt. See the Rhine farther north if you need to. Rick Steves
calls this city a sightseeing lowlight and he is right. <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: C</b> 

<h2>Wurzburg</h2>

This is a nice stop on the way to Munich, but it is somewhat limited
as a tourist destination. This is surprising since there were hordes
of tourists and lots of tour buses 
when we were there. The river is very nice to see. <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: B+</b>

<h2>Rothenburg</h2>

Rothenburg is a 
must see for anyone traveling in the vicinity. There is huge tourism
here, but this surprisingly does not at all detract from the charm of the
city. This is the classic medieval walled city, it's great fun, and
there is lots to see, both inside and outside of the wall. They have
festivals here periodically during the day, and at night the city
empties to leave you with just the cobblestone streets and a much
more serene pace. The historic
atmosphere cannot be beaten and it is downright fun. A good place to
spend our anniversary (which we did). <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: A+</b>


<h2>Munich</h2>

A very accessible city on foot with lots of good sights. The city
gives you a nice taste of Bavarian culture. It also is a good jumping off
point for the Alps if you have a car. Lots of beer gardens and
traditional beer halls, and don't miss the English Garden. 
However, the city is hard to nagivate by
car. Overall a very fun city. <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: A</b>

<h2>Dachau</h2>

The camp museum is very interesting and informative, and is worth a
few hours if you are in Munich. The town is not a tourist destination
so there is not much else to see besides the museum, but is is a nice
slow town that is nice to drive through. <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: B+</b>

<h2>Salzburg</h2>

There is some great scenery here with the mountains, but for me the town was far
too touristy and crowded. A little too much emphasis on Mozart and 
far too many 
tourists (like myself!). This made it hard to 
appreciate the other things the town
had to offer. <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: B</b>

<h2>Berchtesgaden</h2>

A small town nestled in the Bavarian Alps. A drive to the town from
the autobahn gives a good picture of how the locals in this part of the
country live. The main
town is somewhat touristy, but the great vistas of the Alps more than
compensate. The salt mines are also worth visiting. <br> 
<b>Froney's Ranking: A-</b>

<h2>Freiburg</h2>

A very nice small university city at the foot of the Black Forest. We
didn't get to explore much, but what we saw was very nice and
suggested a longer visit would be in order.
<b>Froney's Ranking: A-</b>

<h2>Baden-Baden</h2> 

Another 
must see (and experience) for anyone vacationing in the
area. This town is set in the foothills of the Black Forest and has a
quaint and resortish feel. There is not much in the way of
sightseeing, but there is more than enough shopping, strolling,
casino-ing, hiking in the hills, 
and bathing to keep you busy and happy. The baths
are not to be missed. A true gem with a rommantic and relaxing quality.
There are also nice surrounding drives. <br>
