<p>

The 
<a href=http://euroclub.mit.edu>MIT European Club</a> 
team from Fall 1998. We played in the Sportsman's
League of greater Boston that season. Needless to say, 
several of the teams
were hard pressed to show any sportsmanship at all.
At least the refs liked us. This photo was taken at 
Curry College, which had one of the 
few good pitches that we got to play on that season.

Front: Gary, me, Jacob, Julien, Torkel <br>

David, Jeremy, Adam, Ambrogio

Four of the fourteen players shown in the picture 
are members of the MIT physics 
department (one professor and three students).

Here is our record over several seasons: 

<p>

<b>Sportsman's Team Fall 1998 Record:</b> 1 win, 7 losses, 2 ties <br> 
<b>Sportsman's Team Spring 1999 Record:</b> 3 wins, 5 losses, 2 ties <br>
<b>Sportsman's Team Fall 1999 Record:</b> 4 wins, 5 losses, 1 tie

<a href=http://www.mass-soccer.org>Massachusetts 
State Soccer League</a> in Spring 2000.
