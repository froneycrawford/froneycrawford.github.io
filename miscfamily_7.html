My mom doing a gravestone rubbing in Ireland in 1967 or 1968. This is
from her friend who was accompanying her:

<p>

<i>I was of course the photographer who captured this moment. It was
probably fall of 1967 or spring of 1968, taken during a trip that
Martha and I took to Ireland. Martha had typically planned ahead for
this day – she had done her research on grave rubbings. I had
absolutely no knowledge of this art form, of course, but she was
knowledgeable, determined, and completely prepared to make this
happen—that is, she carried with her the right kind of art paper, tape,
and chalk needed to complete the job. We rented bikes, packed a lunch,
and headed to a graveyard near where we were staying. She then set
about identifying appropriate gravestones and preparing images. Not
surprisingly she was fully absorbed in her work and spend hours doing
her rubbing.  I know that she was justifiably very pleased with the
final product and loved reminiscing about that day. Nearly 20 years
ago when she was in transit between homes, she surprised me with the
framed rubbing which currently hangs in my bedroom.</i>
