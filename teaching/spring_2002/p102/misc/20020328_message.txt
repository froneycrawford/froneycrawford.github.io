A couple of important notes on the Midterm Exam #2 (which is next
week):

1) As I said in class, we will have 4 problems covering 5 chapters
(Ch. 16 through 20). Each problem covers material from one of these
chapters with one chapter not represented.

2) The problems will be in the same format as seen in the last exam
and are a little more involved than the longer problems seen toward
the end of last year's Midterm Exam #2 (which I handed out in class
yesterday for you to try out).

3) By popular demand, in next week's recitation sections we will
discuss material which might appear on the exam. So no group problems
next week, just some exam review and a Q/A session.

4) I will print the four problems on the exam on four separate sheets
of paper, since most of you indicated you preferred that format to the
exam booklet format which we had last time. If you would like the exam
booklet format (like we had last time), YOU MUST SPECIFICALLY SEND ME
EMAIL (by the end of this weekend, please) asking for it and I'll set
it up like the last exam for you.

5) Good news! The class right after our class does not meet on
Fridays, so we can extend the exam to 12:55. IF YOU HAVE A CONFLICT
BETWEEN 12:30 and 1:00 EMAIL ME IMMEDIATELY SO WE CAN MAKE INDIVIDUAL
ARRANGEMENTS. This will give you 80 minutes for the exam, so you won't
feel as rushed. The exam starts promptly at 11:35, so don't be late.

6) You can bring in a standard 8.5 x 11 sheet with equations and notes
on both sides. Also, bring a calculator.
