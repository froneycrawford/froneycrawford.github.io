One more thing I forgot to say in class today. I'll be around during
exam week, so please come in and chat if you want to about the exam or
the material. Don't be shy!

Also, HAVE A GOOD SUMMER. I hope to see most of you next fall around
campus.  I have also been very pleased with the class this term - I
appreciate all of your hard work (I forgot to say all of that at the
end of class).

PS - More detailed message recapping the exam info will follow soon.
