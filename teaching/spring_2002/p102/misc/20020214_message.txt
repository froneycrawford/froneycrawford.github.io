I have made a slight change to the format of the exam. Instead of the
multiple choice question, I have put in a short-answer, qualitative
question.  I have also eliminated one of the quantitative,
problem-solving questions, leaving only three of those.

This should actually help you since I think you will have more time to
work on each problem. Note that this change should not affect how you
study for the exam.

Good luck!
