Here is some info about the first midterm exam. You will be provided
with constants from the front of the Hecht book. See the exam cover
sheet for exactly what will be provided.  The exam lasts 55 minutes
and is an in-class exam on Wed Sep 28. The test covers Hecht Ch. 1 to
4 (inclusive), HW #1 to #4 (inclusive), and all the lecture material
up to the end of Ch. 4. You may bring in a single sheet filled with
equations and constants of your choosing for the test.  The exam cover
sheet has additional instructions, such as bring a calculator, so be
sure to read that. I will also hand out some review materials
(practice problems, old exams, etc.) for you to practice on. Good
luck!
