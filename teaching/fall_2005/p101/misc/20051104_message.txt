Here is some info about the second midterm exam. You will be provided
with constants from the front of the Hecht book and the moments of
inertia from Hecht p. 323.  The exam lasts 55 minutes and is an
in-class exam on Wed Sep 28 (unless you signed up for the special
Tuesday session). The test covers Hecht Ch. 5 to 8 (inclusive), HW #5
to #8 (inclusive), and all the lecture material up to the end of
Ch. 8. You may bring in two sheets filled with equations and constants
of your choosing for the test.  The exam cover sheet has additional
instructions, such as bring a calculator, so be sure to read that.
