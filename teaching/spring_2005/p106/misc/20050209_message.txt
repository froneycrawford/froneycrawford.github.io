Driving home today I realized that my explanation of Doug's question
about diamagnetic materials was completely wrong. Diamagnetism (and
paramagnetism and ferromagnetism) apply to magnetic fields, not
electric fields! So for magnetic fields, the analog to the
permittivity (called the permeability) can indeed be less than one,
but for electric fields, the dielectric constant has to be bigger than
one. Qualitatively, you can think of it this way: the atom in the
dielectric substance gets polarized in the way I described in
class. The electrons always get pulled and protons pushed by the E
field. Thus, the induced field always tends to cancel the external
field. So therefore K is bigger than one.
