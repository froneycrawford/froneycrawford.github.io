From Walter Smith:

To celebrate the completion of the academic year, the physics and
astronomy departments invite you to a gala picnic!  There will be
plenty of good food and drink (including salads and desserts made by
the faculty), and plenty of good conversation!  We'll also have
frisbees, stomp rockets, and other amusements!  Please bring your own
frisbees, etc. to supplement our stock. Please feel free to bring your
significant other.

We'll meet at 5:00 (p.m.!) by the duckpond Monday (May 2). In case of
bad weather, we'll meet at the Zubrow Commons in the INSC. Please
check your e-mail on the day of the picnic--we'll send out a
confirmation of whether we'll be at the duckpond or at the Zu before
2:00 p.m.

Please do come!

--Walter
