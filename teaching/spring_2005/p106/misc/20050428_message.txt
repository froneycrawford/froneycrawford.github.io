Some information on the final exam:

The exam is a 3 hour take-home exam, available 8:30 a.m. Monday, May 2
and due by Friday, May 13 at NOON (which is the end of finals
period).

You will pick up the exam from the INSC secretaries office in
L204. Note that the secretaries are not around in the evenings or
after 4:00 p.m. Also note that you cannot turn in your exam on
weekends. These are the trade-offs for having a take-home exam (with
its advantage of additional time and the flexibility to take the exam
at home). You need to sign your exam OUT and IN. Do not turn in your
exam to my office or under my door. This is a much more secure system.

The exam will be in a brown envelope with your name on it. Do all work
on the sheets provided. You are allowed THREE sides of a standard
sheet for equations and constants.  Return the exam in the same brown
envelope when you are done.

The exam will be cumulative, covering material tested on the two
midterm exams plus physical optics (Ch. 37) and special relativity
(Ch. 38 and handouts).

I will be around during exam week and will be happy to meet with you
one-on-one in the course of your studying if you have questions. Just
email or call to set up a time or at least make sure I am around
before you come by.
