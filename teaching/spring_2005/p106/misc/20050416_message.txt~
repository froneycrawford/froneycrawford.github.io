Hi Class, 

I need to make a slight schedule change. I cannot be in class on Fri
Apr 22, so I need to delay all the scheduled presentations by one
class period. I will post the new schedule (version 2) on the web
site. I hope this doesn't inconvenience anybody. Sorry, but it is last
minute.

That means we will have presentations on Mon Apr 25, Wed Apr 27, and
Fri Apr 29 with the same order of presentation as was outlined in the
handout. Let me know ASAP if this is a problem.

There is also a lab practical exam during exam week, and an additional
informal lab on spectra that Scott and I would like you to do in the
last week. I will also devote a little time in the spectra lab to do a
quantum mechanics lecture (which wont be on any exam, but which you
might find interesting nonetheless). See the revised schedule at:

So, for the overall plan for the rest of the semester it looks like
this (write all this down):

Mon Apr 18 - Lecture on Relativity
Tue Apr 19 - Lab section on interference
Wed Apr 20 - Lecture on Relativity + Lab section on interference
Thu Apr 21 - nothing
Fri Apr 22 - No lecture (class canceled) + HW #12 due in box outside my door by 4 pm

Mon Apr 25 - Class presentations (first group)
Tue Apr 26 - Lab section on spectra and QM lecture
Wed Apr 27 - Class presentations (second group) + Lab section on spectra and QM lecture
Thu Apr 28 - nothing
Fri Apr 29 - Class presentations (third group) and class eval forms + HW #13 due at 4 pm sharp!

Mon May 2 - nothing
Tue May 3 - Lab practical exam for Tue group 
Wed May 4 - Lab practical exam for Wed group


OK, that's it.
