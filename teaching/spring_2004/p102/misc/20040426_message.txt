We will have class outside on Wed and Fri if the weather is nice. I
have reserved a chalkboard. We'll have class just beyond the wall in
front of Hilles when you go out the front door.

On Wed we will discuss part of Hecht Chapter 30, and Fri will be
reserved for review materials, course evaluations, and tying up any
loose ends.
