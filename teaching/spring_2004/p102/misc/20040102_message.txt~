If you are planing to enroll in the course this spring and have not
taken Physics 101 at Haverford in Fall 2003, please come talk to me
(or at least check in with me by sending me an email or calling me on
the phone) about some course logistics and to make sure you have the
right preparation/prerequisites for the course.

In particular, if you took Physics 101 at Haverford in previous years
(i.e., NOT in Fall 2003), I need to discuss with you a module swap
that is occurring this year (Special Relativity, which you have seen
before, is being taught in place of Waves and Oscillations this
spring). This will only affect the first two weeks of class, and then
everyone will be back on the same track.
