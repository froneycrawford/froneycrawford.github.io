I have added some more official office hours to my schedule (Wednesday
2:00-4:00 p.m.) to try to encourage you to come by and see me if you
want to chat. Of course, you can come by and see me at other times; I
am always happy to talk with you.

On a related note, Tuesdays and Thursdays are generally going to be
unreliable for me this semester. On some of these days I may be
working (and babysitting) at home (still checking email though). If you
want, you can call or email me to see if I am around on campus on
these days if you want to stop by. Also, Krsna should be around on
Tuesdays and Thursdays if I am not here and you need to talk.
