There have been some concerns over taking in-class exams and the
uncomfortable nature of having to crowd in to take the exam. I
sympathize with that and also would add that 55 mins is an
unfortunately short amount of time to take a midterm exam.  So, as I
told you in class today, I have decided to give you an different
option for taking the exam on Wed. The option is the following:

Here are the rules: 

* Take the exam anywhere you want (such as the library) for a total of
  90 mins.

* You can take the exam anytime between 11:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Wed.

* There will be no class that day. 

* The exam can be picked up from me at 11:30 outside of H109, and you
  must return the exam by 5:00 p.m. sharp!

* The exam must be returned to my office (L106), either to me
  personally (if I am in), or to the box clearly labeled outside my
  office (if I am not in).

If you are one of the few, the proud, or the brave who wants to take
the exam in class for 55 mins instead of using this option, come see me
today (Mon) and we'll make arrangements.
