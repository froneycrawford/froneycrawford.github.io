Some notes on Midterm #1, which is on Wednesday Feb 18. 

I will hand out a sheet this Friday in class with some of the basic
info (policies, advice, etc). This sheet is the cover sheet on the
exam, so you know what you will be given.

You may use one side of a 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper for
equations. No drawings allowed.

The only way you can miss the exam is with a DEAN'S EXCUSE. Also,
don't be late to the exam! I will make sure we kick the other class
out and start the exam on time.

The exam will cover material from Hecht Ch. 26 and 15.

The exam will cover material from HW #1 through #4, but not the Ch. 16
stuff on HW #4. Some graded problem sets are available for you to pick
up in the box outside my office. Solutions for the problem sets are
also be posted for you to use in studying.

Midterm #1 from last year and the year before are both posted on the
web site with solutions. Use it for practice and to get a feel for
what kinds of questions I might ask. Note that the oscillations stuff
will be replaced with relativity.

We will have a review session on Monday Feb 17 from 6-7 p.m. in
H109. Please come with questions.

I handed out some practice problems in class which were given as
recitation exercises in previous years.

Also, below I have posted some suggested practice problems (with
answers) from Ch. 26 and 15 of Hecht.
