The physics clinic will start this coming week on Wed and Thu. The TAs
have agreed to extend the clinic to 10 p.m. each night during the
semester.  That should give everyone some extra time to get help on if
needed.

The clinic staff are:

Wed 7:00 - 10:00 p.m., Justin Cantley and Amy Perlman
Thu 7:00 - 10:00 p.m., Justin Cantley and Collin Rich
