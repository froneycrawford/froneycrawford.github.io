As promised in our last class, in order to celebrate the completion of
a fantastic year, the physics and astronomy departments invite you to
a gala picnic. There will be plenty of good food and drink (including
salads and desserts made by the faculty, or in my case, bought by the
faculty at the local grocery store), and plenty of good conversation.
We'll also have frisbees, stomp rockets, and Dax the tireless
ball-fetching dog.  Please bring your own frisbees, etc. to supplement
our stock, and also (if you wish) please bring your significant other.

We'll meet at 5:00 p.m. by the duck pond on Tuesday, May 4. In case of
bad weather, we'll meet at Walter Smith's house, 36 Railroad Ave.,
Apt. B. Please check your e-mail on the day of the picnic -- we'll
send out a confirmation of whether we'll be at the duck pond or at
Walter's before 2:00 p.m.

Please do come!
