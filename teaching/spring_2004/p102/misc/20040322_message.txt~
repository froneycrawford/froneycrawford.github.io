Midterm Exam #2 will take place on Wed Apr 2. The format is the same
as it was for the first midterm and the same policies apply. 

This time, you may use two sides of a 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper for
equations. You are welcome to use your sheet from the first midterm
exam as one of those sides.

The exam will cover Hecht Ch. 16 through Ch. 20 and PS #4 through #9.

I will be handing out in class the following review materials for the
exam:

Midterm #2 Exam from 2002 (posted on web page) 
Midterm #2 Exam Solutions from 2002 (posted on web page)

Midterm #2 Exam from 2001 (solutions written on it)

Recitation Group Problems #3 and #4 from 2002
Recitation Group Problems #3 and #4 Solutions from 2002

Tutorial Group Problems #3, #4, and #5 from 2001 (solutions written on
it)

You can use these practice problems to study. I am also trying to get
all of the problem sets up to #8 back from the graders by the end of
the week before the exam (next week). 

We will have a review session on Mon Mar 31 at 7 pm in H109. Please
come with questions.
