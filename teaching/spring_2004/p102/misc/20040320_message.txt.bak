Just a point of clarification regarding an exmaple we did in class in
which a wire loop undergoing a change in magnetic flux was connected
to a capacitor circuit. We calculated the charge on the capacitor
during the change in flux by considering the emf produced and the
voltage across the capacitor. However, a question arose about whether
the charge would take time to build, and how this would affect the
value we calculated. The short of it is that most of the charge builds
on the capacitor after a time equal to the characteristic time, which
equals RC. I didn't specify an R in the problem, but we can imagine
that it would be quite small since the wire has little resistance. So
it takes very little time indeed for us to reach the charge value we
calculated. In the ideal limit in which the wire has no resistance, RC
= 0 and the charge builds up in zero time.
