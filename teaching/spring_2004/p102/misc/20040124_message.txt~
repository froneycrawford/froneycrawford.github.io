The clinic will start this coming week on Wed and Thu. The TAs have
agreed to extend the clinic to 10 p.m. each night so that should give
everyone some extra time to get help on those nights if needed.

The clinic staff are:

Wed 7:00 - 10:00 p.m., Justin Cantley and Amy Perlman
Thu 7:00 - 10:00 p.m., Justin Cantley and Collin Rich
