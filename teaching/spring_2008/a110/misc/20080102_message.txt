Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because
of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me (Froney)
privately early in the semester.  Students should also contact the
Disability Services Coordinator in Counseling Services (Dr. Kenneth
John) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations as
soon as possible.  Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary
inconvenience and delays.
