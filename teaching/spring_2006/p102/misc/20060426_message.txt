As I mentioned in class, the final exam will cover Hecht Ch. 21-25 and
27-30. These correspond to problem sets #9 through #14. Only certain
sections of some of these chapters are covered, so check the course
schedule for specifics. 

In Friday's class, I'll give a talk on the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence (SETI) which will be geared toward non-experts, and I'll
hand out course evaluations.
