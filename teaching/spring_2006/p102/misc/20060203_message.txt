Greetings from Puerto Rico. Scott tells me that you are running a bit
behind in the lecture schedule, so I have scheduled an additional
lecture for Wed Feb 8, from 7-8 p.m. in H109. This will be a normal
class, so please come if you can, but if you can't just be sure to get
the notes from somebody. That means I will get to see a lot of you
THREE TIMES that day!
 
PS - I am available via email until I get back on Tue night.
