Here is some info about the final exam.

The exam will cover material from the following:

Lecture 14 - Lecture 26 (starts with stellar evolution)
PS #4, #5, #6 
Kutner Ch. 10, 11, 8, 14, 15.6, 16 

There is material that was covered in one of these forums, but not the
others (e.g., the Galactic center, which was not covered in
lecture). You are still responsible for that material.

The cover sheet will have the constants from Appendix B, just like the
midterm.

Use one single sided sheet with equations (don't use the midterm sheet
since the exam will cover different material).

The exam is 3 hours and can be picked up in an envelope with your name
on it from the A205 box outside my door. Don't pick it up until you
are ready to take it because I don't want you to risk losing it. Put
it back in the envelope and shove it under my door when you are done.

Bring a calculator.

Please complete the exam by Friday December 19 at 5:00 p.m.

Good luck,
Froney
