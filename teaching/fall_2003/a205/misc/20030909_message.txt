The observing schedule for the semester has been posted and can be
linked from the Astro 205 page. There are many nights that have been
reserved for Astro 205 observing, but be warned that some of them are
guaranteed to be cloudy.

I have office hours Tue 10:00-12:00 noon and Wed 2:00-4:00 p.m., but
of course you can come see me anytime.
