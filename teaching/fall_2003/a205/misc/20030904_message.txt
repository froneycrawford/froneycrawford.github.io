We will have a weekly workshop/recitation session on Mon 3:00-4:00
p.m. in the Observatory. This will allow us to catch up on material,
go over homework issues, and cover some topics not covered in
lecture. This workshop may not meet every week, but keep the time free
each week in case we need it. Our first workshop will be Mon Sep 8.
