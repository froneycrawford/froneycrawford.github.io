Here is the midterm exam info: 

The exam will be a take home exam to be handed out Tue Oct 28 in class
and returned by Fri Oct 31 by 1 pm. Just shove it under my door
(L106).

The exam will be three hours long. You may have one sheet with
equations, and I will have the constants from Appendix B on the cover
sheet.

There will be no class on Thu Oct 30 (which was the originally
scheduled date of the in-class exam).
