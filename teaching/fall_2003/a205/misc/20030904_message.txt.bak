We will have a weekly workshop/recitation session on Mon 3:00-4:00
p.m. This will allow us to catch up on material, go over homework
issues, and cover some topics not covered in lecture. This workshop
may not meet every week, but keep the time free each week in case we
need it. Our firstb workshop will be Mon Sep 8.
