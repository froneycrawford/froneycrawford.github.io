In class today I asked you to fill out your name and availability for
an extra informal recitation meeting (if you were interested in coming
to such a thing). After looking at the responses, almost everyone can
be accommodated at the following times:

Mon 4-5 pm 
Thu 2-3 pm 

So let's schedule meetings for these times in the open study room next
to the rotunda (first floor INSC) . You don't have to come, but it is a
good chance to get extra help and go over stuff with other people
present. Please come with questions.
