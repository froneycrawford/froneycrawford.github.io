I have graded the geometric optics lab (you can pick it 
up outside my office), but I am missing labs from the 
following people: 

Adiarte
Bernardini
Gutnick
Hunt
S. Kim
Leue
Tung
Welsh 

If you are on this list and turned one in, please see me 
ASAP so we can track it down. If you did not turn one in,
please do so by Tue or Wed (20% penalty applies), after 
that it is 40% penalty. 

Note: you MUST turn in all labs to pass the class, so at 
the very LEAST you need to turn it in by Fri May 2 by 4pm (last day of classes)
 to avoid failure!
