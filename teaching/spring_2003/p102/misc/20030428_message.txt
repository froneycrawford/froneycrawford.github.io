Some end of semester announcements:

1) All course work is due on the last day of classes, Fri May 2 by
4:00 pm. NO EXCEPTIONS!

2) All labs must be turned in to pass the class. Don't miss a lab
report!

3) The final exam from last year (and solutions) linked from the class
web page. I will also hand out review material this week for the final
exam. Here are the items I will hand out:

Recitation #7 problems (with solutions) from 2002 
Tutorial #6 and # 7 problems (with solutions) from 2001

If you did not get a copy, you can stop by my office and pick it up.

4) I will be around most of the time during exam week if you want to
stop in to talk.

5) There is a physics picnic at the Duck Pond on Tue May 6. Please 
stop by for some food, drink, and conversation. I'll give more 
details in class once I know them.
