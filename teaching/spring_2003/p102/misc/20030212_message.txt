Some notes on Midterm #1, which is on Wed Feb 19. I handed out a sheet
today with some of the basic info (policies, advice, etc).

The only way you can miss the exam if with a DEAN'S EXCUSE. Also,
don't be late to the exam!

The exam will cover material Hecht Ch. 10, 11, and 15

The exam will cover material in PS #1 through #4, but not the Ch. 16
stuff on PS #4. The first three problem sets have been graded and are
available for you in the box outside my office. Solutions for the
problem sets will also be posted for you to also use in studying.

Midterm #1 from last year is posted on the web site with
solutions. Use it for practice and to get a feel for what kinds of
questions I might ask. The exam this year will be slightly longer.

We will have a review session on Mon Feb 17 at 7 pm in H109. Please
come with questions.
