We will NOT have class this Friday, Feb 7. 

However, homework problem set #3 is still due that day (as well as
anything you took an extension on).

You must turn in your problem set to the labeled large box outside my
office (Koshland INSC L106) by Friday 3 pm AT THE LATEST. Someone will
pick up the box at that time and take it away. Don't be late or else I
will dock you an extension!
