Hello, and welcome back!

This is a reminder that the first meeting of the Physics 102
Laboratory is next week (Tuesday or Wednesday 1:15-4:00).  If you
haven't signed up for a specific afternoon, please see us.

If you don't have a lab manual, please see Scott Shelley in room L207
of the INSC as soon as possible.

Because of time constraints this semester, we were unable to promptly
get the lab manuals to the bookstore.  As a result, we'll be
collecting $5 per student to offset the photocopying charges we
incurred.  Please bring this to your first lab session, if possible.

The subject of the first experiment is Sound.  You're encouraged to
bring an instrument to lab, if you own one!
