After our discussion in class today regarding the homework for next
week (PS #9), I have decided to do to the following: I will assign 5
problems to be graded (20 pts each) and 5 additional practice problems
which will not be graded. These problems are all significantly easier
than the typical 20 pt problem on a problem set, so it should not take
you as long to complete this as it would a normal problem set. Please
be sure to also do the practice problems at some point and make sure
you understand how to do them. This PS will be due Fri Nov 15 (as per
the regular schedule), but I hope the lessened work load this week
will meet with your approval. Come see me if you have questions or
concerns.
