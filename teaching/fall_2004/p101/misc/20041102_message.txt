Some information about Midterm Exam #2: 

We will have an exam review session on Mon Nov 8 from 6-7 p.m. in
H109. Please come with questions and topics to discuss.

The exam will take place on Wed Nov 10. I will have the exam ready for
you to pick up from my office between 10:30 and 11:30 a.m.  You will
have a single 90 minute period to take the exam anywhere you like. You
can use any 90 minute block between 10:30 and 5:00 p.m. that day. You
must return the exam to me in person in L106 by 5:00 p.m. If I am not
in my office when you come by to return the test, then you must return
the exam to the box in the secretaries office in L204. Do not leave
the exam lying around unattended or try to slip it under my door!

The exam covers material from Hecht Ch.5 through Ch. 8 inclusive. This
corresponds to HW #5 through #8 and lecture dates from 9/22 to 10/29
on the syllabus.

You may have a total of two sides of an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper
for equations for the test. I recommend just using your old sheet from
the last exam and making up one new sheet to go with it, but you don't
have to do this.

I will be posting some practice problems for you on the web site and
will hand out solutions in class.
