Some of you expressed concern that the midterm exam #2 questions did
not relate to the problems covered in lecture, HW, and the review
packets.

I have looked through those sources and have identified the following
problems which I believe are in fact similar to the exam questions. I
urge to to look over these and consider the connections. If you still
feel that the exam was not representative then please come talk to me.

EXAM PROBLEM #1 - satellite going around Earth 

PS #5, problem #7 - lunar module
practice exam, problem II-1 
Ch. 5 notes, circular orbits examples

EXAM PROBLEM #2 - masses falling toward each other

PS #6, problem #7 - space probe 
practice exam, problem I-2 
Ch. 6 notes, energy conservation

EXAM PROBLEM #3 - billiard balls collide

PS #7, problem #2 - batter in boat
PS #7, problem #6 - colliding skaters
Physics in Forensics review problem
Ch. 7 notes - 2D collisions

EXAM PROBLEM #4 - merry-go-round

PS #8, problem #6 - clay wad hits wheel
practice exam, problem III-1  
Ch. 8 notes, conservation of angular momentum

EXAM PROBLEM #5 - yo-yo

Ch. 8 notes, rolling wheel example
Ch, 8 notes, moment of inertia with pulleys

Note that none of these problems are EXACTLY like the ones on the
exam, but they use the same concepts. I wanted to see if I could get
you to connect common themes to solve a new set of problems.
