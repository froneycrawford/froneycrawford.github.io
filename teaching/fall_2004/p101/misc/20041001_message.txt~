Here is a chance for you to earn back some of the points you lost on
the first midterm exam.

After the exam has been graded and returned, you have the option of
writing up a complete solution of any of the problems that you lost
points on (this writeup is untimed). Use a separate piece of paper for
each problem (don't write it on the exam). You must do this by
yourself using only your lecture notes and the Hecht book as a
resource (you can also use your equation sheet, which is available for
pickup outside my office).  I will look at your solutions and give you
up to a maximum of half of the missed points back for a correct solution.

Please be patient with getting the exams back. I will try to get them
to you by fall break, but I cannot guarantee that. The due date for
the exam redemption will be decided when you get your exam back.

Also, it is important not to discuss the exam problems with anybody. I
will post the exam solutions online once the due date for the points
redemption has passed.
