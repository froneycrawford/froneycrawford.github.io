The exam is ready and can be picked up in the secretaries office
(L204). The office there is only open from 8:00 - 4:30, so be sure to
plan to pick it up during those hours. If you want to take it
overnight, return it the next morning. You will need to sign out and
sign in the exam. Let me know if you encounter any problems. Good
luck!
