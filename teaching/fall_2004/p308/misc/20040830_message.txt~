The PHYS 308 lectures on MWF 9:30 - 10:30 have been officially moved
to the Observatory classroom to accommodate the large class size. The
recitation section will remain (for now) in Link 205 at the stated time. I have
modified the course information download to reflect the change. Please
download a new copy at your leisure.
