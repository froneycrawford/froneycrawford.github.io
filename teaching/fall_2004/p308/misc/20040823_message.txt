Faculty have been asked to advertise the following in their courses:

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because
of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me [Froney]
privately early in the semester.  Students should also contact Rick
Webb, Coordinator, Office of Disabilities Services
(rwebb@haverford.edu, 610-896-1290) to verify their eligibility for
reasonable accommodations as soon as possible.  Early contact will
help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.
