As I stated in class, my office hours are:

Mon 3:00 - 4:30 p.m.
Tue 2:00 - 4:00 p.m.
Wed 3:30 - 5:00 p.m.

But you can stop by anytime (and I encourage you to please do so).

I also gave my phone numbers out in class and they are posted on my
office door as well. Email is also a good way to reach me.  Please
don't hesitate to contact me.
