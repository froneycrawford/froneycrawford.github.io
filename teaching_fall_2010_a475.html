<font size=+2>Welcome</font>

<ul>

Welcome to the Fall 2010 edition of <font color=#66FFFF>Astronomy
475: Experimental Methods of Astrophysics</font> taught by <a
href=./index.html>Froney Crawford</a>.
In this course we will cover various experimental and observational 
aspects of astronomy and will conduct labs and projects.

<p>

</ul>

<br>

<font size=+2>Course Overview and Schedule</font>

<br>

<ul>

After a brief introduction to astronomical coordinates, the first
third of the course will cover optical astronomy, with an emphasis on
optical telescopes, optical observing techniques, and optical
instrumentation (including CCDs) in support of observing projects that
we will conduct throughout the semester.  We will then cover image
processing, general signal processing, and filtering basics before
moving into a discussion of radio astronomy in the middle third of the
course. We will cover radio astronomy basics, instrumentation,
telescopes, and observing techniques. We will also discuss non-thermal
radio emission processes and radio science.  The last part of the
course will cover X-ray astronomy (including X-ray detectors) and
possibly gravitational wave astronomy as well, and during the last
week of class, there will be student presentations on independent
projects.

<p>

For the independent projects, each person will select and follow up on
a facet of observational astronomy not already covered in the
course. Aside from a ~30 min. presentation given to the class on your
topic, you will also submit a paper (with references) at the end of
the course. I'll have more to say about these independent projects
later in the semester.  We will also have (almost) weekly problem sets
which will be graded, and I plan to give a midterm and final exam.

<p>

The plan is to have a variety of labs which will 
be closely tied to the lecture part of
the course.  I hope that the topics covered in the class discussions
in the first part of the course will support the lab activities
throughout the semester. I will have more to say to you about labs
once the course starts. 

<p>

Since physics plays a major role in the discussion and understanding
of the topics in this course, I will make free use of physical
concepts that you should have seen and become familiar with by the time
you are a senior (for instance, physical optics and diffraction, to give just an
example).  You must be familiar with this level of physics to keep
up in the course.

<p>

<br>

<font size=+2>Meeting Times</font>

<br>

<ul>


We will meet on the fourth floor of Hackman on <font color=#66FFFF>Tue
and Thu from 1:30 - 2:50 p.m.</font>, and also on <font
color=#66FFFF>Thu nights from 7:20 - 9:20 p.m.</font>. 
Attendance required (of course!).

<font size=+2>Grading</font>

<br>

<ul>

For the purposes of grading, a rough breakdown is as follows:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Midterm Exam (20%)</font> <br>
<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Final Exam (20%)</font> <br>
<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Labs (25%)</font> <br>
<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Homework (25%)</font> <br> 
<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Independent Project (10%)</font>  

</ul>

<p>

I reserve the right to adjust your grade to some extent at the end of
the semester to reflect effort, conscientiousness, participation, etc.

<p>


</ul>

<br>

<font size=+2>Textbooks</font>

<br>

<ul>

There are several books which will be useful for the optical astronomy
portion of the course. These are:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a
href=http://www.amazon.com/Observing-Universe-Observational-Astronomy-Planetary/dp/0521603935/sr=1-1/qid=1167970750/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-2820399-3474869?ie=UTF8&s=books><i>Observing
the Universe: A Guide to Observational Astronomy and Planetary
Science</i></a> by Andrew J. Norton (Editor)

<li> <a
href=http://www.amazon.com/Observational-Astronomy-D-Scott-Birney/dp/0521853702/sr=1-1/qid=1167970667/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-2820399-3474869?ie=UTF8&s=books><i>Observational
Astronomy</i></a> (2nd edition) by D. Scott Birney, Guillermo
Gonzalez, & David Oesper

<li> <a
href=http://www.amazon.com/Astronomy-Cambridge-Observing-Handbooks-Astronomers/dp/0521617626/sr=1-1/qid=1167970587/ref=sr_1_1/105-2820399-3474869?ie=UTF8&s=books><i>Handbook
of CCD Astronomy</i></a> (2nd edition) by Steve B. Howell

<li> Bill Romanishin's online book <a
href=http://hildaandtrojanasteroids.net/book2513.html>"An Introduction to
Astronomical Photometry Using CCDs"</a> (in pdf format). Make sure you
get the latest version (dated 22Oct06).

</ul>

<p>

Each of these books takes a slightly different approach and has a
different emphasis and coverage, but taken together they provide the
necessary background for our discussion.

<p>

For the radio astronomy portion of the course, we will be using:

<ul>

<li> <a
href=http://www.amazon.com/Tools-Radio-Astronomy-Astrophysics-Library/dp/3540403876/ref=ed_oe_h><i>Tools
of Radio Astronomy</i></a> (4th revision) by K. Rohlfs and T. L. Wilson.

</ul>


<p>

This book has extensive (and readable) coverage
of the field and is a good resource to have handy even after the
course is over.

<p>

For the last part of the course covering X-rays and gravitational
waves (and for your independent projects), you will need to pay close
attention to the class notes and perhaps do some digging around on
your own in some of the books in the library.
