<ul>

Welcome to the Spring 2014 edition of <font color=#66FFFF>Solar System
Astrophysics </font>, taught by <a href=./index.html>Froney
Crawford</a>.  This web page will serve as the source of information,
announcements, and downloads for this course.  Please check it
regularly.

<p>

The main textbook for the course is <i><a
href=http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-Bradley-Carroll/dp/0805304029/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1198183422&sr
=1-1>An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics</a></i> (2nd edition) by
Carroll and Ostlie. This book is also useful for other astronomy
courses you might take since it covers a wide range of topics in
astrophysics.  We will also make use of several physics textbooks as
supplemental resources, including introductory physics texts such as
the one you used in Physics 111 and 112 and the excellent mechanics
textbook
<i><a href=http://www.uscibooks.com/taylor2.htm>Classical
Mechanics</a></i> by John R. Taylor. Please be sure to keep these textbooks
handy.

<p>


The course is divided into modules. The discussion of each module
includes a review of the physical principles and concepts needed to
understand and connect phenomena observed in the solar system.  Each
module has a separate assignment associated with it.  During the last
part of the course, we will have student presentations on independent
topics.  Each presentation will be roughly 30-40 mins.  The goal of
the independent project is for you to go in depth into a facet of
solar system astrophysics that we have not covered in the course and present
it to the class. More
details can be found in the general course information and policies
document.
