<font size=+2>Welcome</font>

<ul>

Welcome to the Spring 2008 edition of <font color=#66FFFF>Astronomy
210: Solar System Astrophysics</font> taught by <a
href=./index.html>Froney Crawford</a>. The plan for the course is to
cover an array of interesting physical phenomena in the solar
system, with significant time spent prior to each topic preparing
the necessary physics background.

<p>

</ul>

<br>

<font size=+2>Course Overview and Tentative Schedule</font>

<br> 

<ul>

Some of the topics that I hope we will cover in the course include:

<p>

<ol>

<font color=#FFAAAA>

<li> <i>Tides; Tidal Locking; Lagrange Points; Non-inertial
Reference Frames; Roche Limit; Io</i>

<p>

<li> <i>Planetary Atmospheres; Fluid Statics and Dynamics; Greenhouse
Effect; Albedo; Atmospheric Escape</i>

<p>

<li> <i>Planetary Composition; Temperature and Cooling of Interiors;
Phases of Matter</i>

<p>

<li> <i>Planetary Seismology; Elastic Waves in Solids; Oblateness and
Moment of Inertia</i>

<p>

<li> <i>Magnetic Fields; Magnetospheres; Auroras; Solar Dynamo; Earth's
Field; Jupiter and Io</i>

<p>

<li> <i>Solar Wind; Alfven Waves; Plasmas; Comet Tails; Radiation
Pressure</i>

<p>

<li> <i>Dynamical Systems and Rings; Orbital Resonance; Chaos and
Non-linear Systems; Collisions with Earth</i>

<p>

<li> <i>Solar System Age and Formation; Radioactive Dating;
Planetary Formation; Hill Radius; Extrasolar Planets</i>

</font>

<p>

</ol>

However, these might change to some extent as we proceed.

<p>

Since physics plays a major role in the discussion and understanding
of the topics in this course, I will make free use of physical
concepts that are typically seen at the freshman and sophomore levels
(for instance, physical optics and diffraction, to give an
example). You should be familiar with physics at this level at least 
to keep up in the course.

<p>

During the last two weeks of class, there will be student presentations on
independent projects.  For the independent projects, each person will
select and follow up on a facet of solar system astrophysics not
already covered in the course. Aside from a ~30 min. presentation
given to the class on your topic, you will also submit a paper (with
references) at the end of the course. I'll have more to say about
these independent projects later in the semester. We will also have
(almost) weekly assignments which will be graded, and I plan to give a
final exam.

<p>

</ul>

<br>

<font size=+2>Meeting Times</font>

<br>

<ul>

We will meet on the fourth floor of Hackman on <font color=#66FFFF>Tuesdays
and Thursdays from 10:30 to 11:50 a.m.</font>. Attendance required (of
course!).

<br>


<font size=+2>Grading</font>

<br>

<ul>

For the purposes of grading, a rough breakdown is as follows:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Homework Assignments (50%)</font> <br>
<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Independent Project (15%)</font>
<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Final Exam (25%)</font> <br>
<li> <font color=#66FFFF>Participation (10%)</font>

</ul>

<p>

I reserve the right to adjust your grade to some extent at the end of
the semester to reflect effort, conscientiousness, participation, etc.
(this is also reflected in the participation component of the grade).

<font size=+2>Textbooks</font>

<br>

<ul>


The main textbook for the course is <i><a
href=http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-Bradley-Carroll/dp/0805304029/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1198183422&sr=1-1>An
Introduction to Modern Astrophysics</a></i> (2nd edition) by Carroll
and Ostlie. This book is also useful for other astronomy courses you
might take since it covers a wide range of topics in astrophysics.

<p>

We will also make use of several physics textbooks as supplemental
resources, including introductory physics texts such as the one you
used in Physics 111 and 112 and the excellent mechanics textbook
<i><a href=http://www.uscibooks.com/taylor2.htm>Classical
Mechanics</a></i> by John R. Taylor. Please be sure to keep these textbooks
handy.
