<h1>Advice and Tips on Raising Chickens</h1> 

<b>by Fronefield Crawford</b>

<p>

Here is some advice about raising chickens in a suburban environment
and some important elements to include when making a chicken coop. I
gained this wisdom through much trial and error, so maybe it will help
someone else avoid some of the common pitfalls experienced by this
novice chicken owner. There is no particular order to this.

<h2>Three ways to keep chickens</h2>

<p>

First, there are three ways in which you can keep chickens:

<ol> 

<li> <b>Free range</b>

<p>

<i>Advantages:</i> It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all
around. They also eat healthy stuff (and bugs) in the yard.

<p>

<i>Disadvantages:</i> The mess (droppings plus scratched up
plants/grass/yard) is not contained, and the droppings can end up in
places like your driveway. They are vulnerable to predators during the
day (particularly foxes and hawks). They can wander into your
neighbor's yard and annoy them with droppings and damaging the yard.


<li> <b>Limited range</b>

<p>

You can make up a fence (see fence section below) which will contain
them. 

<p>

<i>Advantages:</i> You still get the free range aspect without a big
risk of having them run around all over (though this can still happen
if your fence isn't super high).

<p>

<i>Disadvantages:</i> Still susceptible to predators (foxes and hawks)
during the day. Fence can be a bit ugly unless a lot of effort is made
to make it look nice. Fence supplies can add up in cost. Whatever land
you put within the fence will be destroyed eventually by the chickens,
so consider it a barren wasteland.

<p>

The predator problem can be alleviated with a covered fenced-in run.

<li> <b>Completely housed (in a coop)</b>

<p>

<i>Advantages:</i> Safety. No worries about chickens roaming into
neighbor's yard. Easier to handle larger numbers of birds without
making a neighborhood spectacle of yourself chasing after your
chickens all the time.

<p>

<i>Disadvantages:</i> No free range diet, dirt baths, etc. In short,
not as much fun for chickens and for you to watch.

</ol>

<h2>What breed of bird should you get?</h2>

I prefer the egg layers since they are generally docile and produce
nice eggs. You can get a wide variety of chickens, but some are
flighty, and some don't produce a lot of eggs. A rooster is only
necessary if you want a fight every time you approach the coop (don't
underestimate the nastiness of a rooster with sharp claws). It also
makes a racket, which can annoy the neighbors. You don't need a
rooster to get eggs. Remember that. Hens are much quieter. My favorite
breeds are:

<p>

<ul>

<li> Rhode Island Red. Great layer of brown eggs. Good looking
chicken. Good disposition.

<li> Buff Orpington. Fat yellow chicken which lays brown eggs. Very
docile.

<li> Barred Rock. Interesting black and white striped pattern. Decent
layer of brown eggs and good disposition.

<li> Americauna. Fuzzy face, large chicken. Lays blue eggs! Good
disposition, generally friendly.

<li> White Leghorn. Prolific white egg layer. Very nervous/flighty,
though. So not as docile. 

</ul>


<h2>Fence?</h2>

For a fence (for limited range chickens), standard hexagonal chicken
wire (poultry netting) is good for the fence wall (and cheap). You can
go with stiffer stuff but I don't think it is necessary. My fence was
about 4 feet high and the posts were green metal garden stakes. I
connected the tops of the posts with 2x3 wooden beams, which looked a
little better and allowed me to tie the hex fencing to the cross beams
with cable ties. I used cable ties for almost all fence ties (very
handy) and small drywall screws to attach the wooden beams to the
garden stakes (the stakes have several holes in which a screw can be
put). I used 48-inch high hex netting and had a bit of fence at the
bottom left over which I could curl inward into the pen. After putting
some rocks on this flat part of the netting, it was hard for animals
to dig under. The chickens certainly can't get through it. That was
all fine, but the chickens can actually hop up onto and over a 4 foot
fence, especially if they learn how to do it one time (or watch a
fellow chicken do it). They will eventually come back after foraging
away from the pen, but they won't be contained. Also, predators like
foxes can easily get over a fence like that, and they will do so even
during the day if you live in a forested or wild area. Don't forget to
make a gate so you can get in and out of the pen. I used a baby gate
(previously mounted at top of the stairs in the house) 
for this purpose and it worked well. It attaches easily to
the garden stakes as posts.

<p>

<h2>Coop Design</h2>

<i>The coop must be secure! The coop must be secure! The coop must be
secure!</i> If not, all your chickens will be attacked at night and
gone in a matter of days (once the predators figure out they are
there). For mesh, use hardware cloth not the hex netting (not strong
enough). Any slit wider then about an inch (or maybe a bit less) is
asking for trouble.

<p>

You can usually gauge when the chickens are miserable and when they
are content. If they are miserable (from being too wet or cold, for
instance), consider changing these things to make them a little
happier.

<p>

Chickens need a bit of space or else they will peck each other, and
this can be quite gruesome if left to continue. Don't stack them up
too closely for this reason, plus they'll be miserable.

<p>

Make doors with latches (deadbolts are what I use). Raccoons and other
clever animals can defeat simple locks. 

<p>

Ideally, your coop should be large enough to house the birds and their
food and water, which is better kept inside the coop if you can manage
it. A hanging feeder is best so they don't step in the food and make a
mess. A water font is best since it prevents the same messiness as
with the feeder and stores a lot of water. Try to make each of these
available at the height of the chicken's back so they don't climb on
it and make droppings in it. I hang an orange rubber cone directly
over the water font so that they don't hop on it to roost (and make a
droppings mess in their water).

<p>

The coop should have plenty of roosting space (a roosting bar or two)
for all birds since that is where they like to sleep (on such
bars). An inch width or a bit wider is fine for this. Keep it away
from the food and water.

<p>

Some ventilation is nice, but if it gets cold in the winter, remember
that they'll need a tarp or wooden board or some such thing to prevent
freezing wind from blowing through.

<p>

Make the roof slanted to that snow and rain will roll off and not
accumulate, which can ruin the roof (makes it rot and leak). Even a
small slant will do, just not flat.

<p>

If your coop is more like chicken house (not just a glorified box),
try to get some straw or pine shavings for the floor. It'll smell
better and be much easier to clean when the time comes.

<p>

Try to keep the coop dry, so make the roof extend beyond the wall of
the coop a bit so the rain doesn't drip into the coop. A good roof
material to use is tar paper (essentially a big shingle which can be
rolled out on the roof). It is good in weather, easy to install, and
not too expensive. If your coop gets significantly wet inside, your
chickens will be miserable plus it makes the coop a real hassle to
clean and makes it reek. A dry coop won't smell too bad, so that's one
way to can tell if it is getting too dirty and wet.

<p>

<h2>Cleaning the coop</h2>

From time to time you'll have to clean the coop. I find that an ice
scraper is very useful for clearing the droppings off a smooth surface
(usually the droppings are dry unless your coop is getting rain in it)
and works just like it does clearing ice from your windshield. If you
have a removable floor, that's good, but that is really only feasible
for the small coop (glorified box). For the larger coop, you'll have
to shovel. In any case, unless things get really wet and you wait
beyond the time you should to clean it out, it is not too offensive.

<p>

<h2>Nests and Collecting Eggs</h2> 

You'll need a nest or two in the coop (someplace tucked away with some
bedding in it, like straw) for the chickens to lay their eggs. The
nest can be as small as a shoebox (but not much smaller than that) but
I recommend slightly larger nests. Using cardboard won't last very
long, so I prefer wood or plastic.  For up to 10 chickens, I think one
nest is probably enough. But having two or more nests in that case
will avoid any conflicts that might arise with that number of
chickens.

<p>

A chicken may lay as much as one egg a day.  They'll consistently lay
in the same place once they get the hang of it in a day or two. These
eggs can accumulate for a couple of days, but don't wait too long or
else the eggs might go bad, especially if it is very hot. If it is
extremely cold, the eggs will freeze, expand, and crack the shell. If
you have enough room in the coop so as not to overcrowd the chickens,
the eggs should be pretty much totally clean when you collect them
from the nest. If clean, take them directly to fridge (don't
wash). Why?  Because the egg shells are covered with an antibacterial
layer when they are laid which helps keep them fresh. If there is mess
on the shell when you collect the egg, wash the egg and scrub with an
abrasive plastic brush until clean. Then take immediately to the
fridge.

<p>

For a free range chicken, the chicken will probably find some place in
the yard to start laying, so you'll have to track down the nesting
place as an egg hunt. 

<p>

I recommend giving eggs to your neighbors as often as possible. It is
important to be a good neighborhood citizen when you have chickens in
your yard.


<h2>Automatic Door Option</h2>

<p>

How about an automatic door?

<p>

This option is expensive but very handy, especially if you plan to
have your chickens outside for any length of time. It basically frees
you from having to open the coop door in the morning and close it up
at night. I have used the <a
href=https://www.flytesofancy.co.uk/chickenhouses/VSB-Automatic-Door-Opener.html>VSB automatic door</a> with light sensitive opener (opens at
dawn, closes at dusk). It works great and hasn't run out of battery
power in a couple of years. I built a little wooden roof over the
sensor piece so it wouldn't get rained on, and I added a plexiglass
front cover over the sensor so rain and snow wouldn't get in there
either.

<p>

If the chickens are outside during the day, the chickens will
automatically come home to the coop to roost for the night when it
gets dark. So you won't have to track them down and catch them every
night. It might be a good idea to keep them inside the coop for a
couple of days if possible or manually put them into the coop if they
don't get the picture on the first few nights until they realize that
this is home. They may start roosting in the trees when they first
start living in the coop.

<p>

If you need to catch a chicken and get it into the coop at night, it
is better to wait until it is dark out. While it is light, the chicken
will run around and away from you and can be quite difficult to catch
(unless it is used to being held a lot and then is easy to catch and
hold). Once it is dark, it won't run around but will sit there hoping
it won't be seen. You can approach the chicken with a flashlight
quietly and it will stare at you while you shine it in its face. Then
when you are ready to get hold of it, make the grab fast and tight
(secure). It'll freak out when you grab it, but just hold tight for a
second and it will pass. Then you can put the chicken in the coop.

<h2>Cold Weather</h2>

Most of the usual chicken breeds do pretty well in the cold weather
(below freezing, even), but expect egg production to dramatically
decrease or stop while it is cold and dark. As long as the fowls are
protected from excessive wind and exposure, they'll be OK (for
instance, don't leave lots of open wire mesh windows in the coop --
cover them with plywood or plexiglass or something). Plexiglass is nice
as a window cover because it is durable and allows sunlight to enter,
giving some solar gain during the day (but it is a bit more
expensive).

<p>

One other important item concerning cold weather: frozen water. The
water in the waterer will freeze into a block of ice when it drops
below freezing. One solution to this is to get a heated base for metal
water heaters. This is essentially an upside-down metal pan with a
cord that plugs into a standard socket. Place the metal waterer on top
of the base and it will keep the water unfrozen. Unfortunately, you
have run an extension cord out to the coop to provide power during the
winter months. This kind of heater works great, but a a metal waterer
if preferred owing to its better thermal conductivity.  I have used
both plastic and metal, and the plastic container does have iced-over
water in the trough if it gets very cold, but not enough to keep the
chickens from having any water at all. The metal never has these
issues.  More evidence that a plastic waterer will work is seen in
pictures taken by chicken expert <a
href=http://www.terrygolson.com/>Terry Golson</a> of her coop which
shows a plastic waterer on top of what appears to be the heater.  If,
on the other hand, you have a smaller waterer and want use a canning
jar with a screw-on plastic base (and forget the heater), be sure not
to use a glass jar (use a plastic one instead). The glass will crack
when the water freezes and expands, and then you have shards of glass
in your coop.

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

When holding a chicken, look for descriptions on the web for the right
way to do this. I put my arm under the chicken from behind so that my
fingers curl up onto the chicken's chest (the chicken is facing away
from me), and I lay my other hand on the chickens back so its wings
don't flap. A good video on how to pick up and hold a chicken is
presented <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJdkmgiUqs8>here</a>.

<p>

Chickens like to take a dirt bath from time to time and are happiest
doing so (this argues for the limited or free range model).
