<h1>Background</h1>

<p>

Since the discovery of pulsars in the 1960's and their subsequent
identification as rapidly rotating neutron stars (for which the 1974
Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded), pulsars have provided a unique
insight into the nature of physics at high energies and in extreme
conditions.

<p>

A neutron star is formed in a supernova explosion, which results when
a massive star runs out of fuel at the end of its life.  A neutron
star is the remnant of such an explosion and is extremely dense,
weighing as much as 3e33 grams (1.5 times as much as our own sun) but
having only a 10 km radius (about the size of Manhattan). The
combination of high mass and small size results in an extremely large
gravitational field, estimated to be about 100 billion times that on
Earth.

<p>

A newly-formed neutron star can be sent rapidly spinning in the
supernova explosion, and such a star can have a magnetic field many
orders of magnitude larger than those found on Earth. In some cases,
the spinning highly magnetized neutron star generates enough electric
potential to accelerate charges from the surface of the star,
resulting in a beam of non-thermal radio emission which rotates with
the star. An observer sees this rotating beam as a series of radio
pulses as the beam sweeps across the line of sight, 
similar to the rotating beacon of a lighthouse. Such an object
is called a pulsar.

<p>

The Crab pulsar, located in the Crab supernova remnant which was
formed in the supernova explosion seen in 1054 A.D. by Chinese
astronomers, is the youngest known pulsar and is considered to be the
prototypical young pulsar with a spin period of 33 ms. More typical
pulsars have much longer spin periods (about 1 sec), though there is a
class of old, recycled pulsars which have obtained very fast rotation
rates through the transfer of angular momentum from a stellar
companion throughout its lifetime. This class of pulsars usually has
spin periods of a few milliseconds, thereby lending the name
millisecond pulsars to this class of objects. The fastest millisecond
pulsar known has a spin period of 1.6 milliseconds, corresponding to
642 rotations per second.

<p>

Most pulsars which exhibit detectable radio emission are not
detectable in other radiation wavebands, since the radiation that is
produced falls off in brightness steeply with increasing radiation
frequency. However, in some cases (such as the Crab pulsar, mentioned
above), the pulsar can be detected in multiple wavelengths. In fact, a
relatively new class of pulsars has been found, called Anomalous X-ray
Pulsars (or AXPs for short), which shows only X-ray emission and no
detectable radio emission. These AXPs are characterized by long spin
periods and very large magnetic fields.

<p>

A tutorial on radio pulsars outlining more basic background
information on the subject is available on the World Wide Web at
<a href=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~pulsar/psr/Tutorial/tut/tut.html>http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~pulsar/psr/Tutorial/tut/tut.html</a>.

<h1>Physics in Extreme Conditions</h1>

<p>

As a pulsar spins, it loses energy through electromagnetic radiation
and a plasma wind. Thus, although the spin period of the pulsar is
very steady, it does spin down over a long period of time as it loses
energy. By invoking a simple dipolar model of the magnetic field and
by making some other assumptions, an observer can convert a measured
pulse period and period derivative for a pulsar into physical
parameters, such as age of the pulsar, surface magnetic field
strength, and energy loss rate.  For typical pulsars, a value of a
trillion Gauss is not uncommon for the surface magnetic field
strength.  More indirect means can be used to probe the interior
structure of neutron stars, which are thought to have densities in
excess of 100 trillion grams per cubic centimeter.

<p>

These kinds of magnitudes indicate the value of studying such systems:
nothing approaching these conditions can be produced in terrestrial
physics laboratories, and it is only through studying these kinds of
systems that some theoretical models in physics can be tested. A prime
example of this was the awarding of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics
for the confirmation of general relativity as the correct
gravitational theory through the use of radio pulse measurements of a
binary pulsar system.

<p>

<h1>The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey</H1>

<p>

Over the years a number of searches for new pulsars have been
undertaken at a variety of observatories around the world using
different instruments and techniques. As of 1997, thirty years after
the discovery of the first pulsar, about 750 pulsars were known and
had been catalogued. In mid-1997, an international collaboration
involving research groups in the UK, Australia, USA, and Italy
undertook a new high-frequency (1400 MHz) survey of the southern
Galactic plane using a new instrument mounted on the 64-meter radio
telescope in Parkes, Australia (<a href=./gif/mhyst1.gif>Figure 1</a>). 
This survey was designed to
search the range <b>-</b>100 to +50 degrees in Galactic longitude within 5
degrees of the Galactic plane.

<p>

The new instrument which has motivated this survey is a ``multibeam''
receiver and is capable of observing 13 distinct parts of the sky at
once, thereby increasing surveying capacity by a factor of 13. This is
equivalent to having 13 separate telescopes the size of the Parkes
telescope for use in the pulsar search effort. This new survey (called
the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey, or PM Survey for short) is about 7
times more sensitive than previous surveys conducted at this radio
frequency.

<p>

The high frequency of the PM Survey also has an important advantage
over previous searches at more traditional lower radio frequencies
(400 MHz), where pulsars are typically much brighter. In the Galactic
plane, radio wave propagation effects such as dispersive pulse delays
and multipath radio scattering of pulses severely limit sensitivity to
pulsed emission at low frequencies. These effects get worse for
pulsars which are distant since there is a great deal of interstellar
dispersive and scattering plasma between the observer and the
pulsar. The effect of the plasma is a frequency-dependent pulse delay
which depends on the integrated electron density along the line of
sight, which is called the dispersion measure. Thus, the PM Survey is
the first large-scale pulsar survey to be sensitive to distant pulsars
in the Galactic plane, where there are large dispersion measures
(<a href=./gif/mhyst2.gif>Figure 2</a>).

<p>

With only 65% of the survey completed to date, the PM Survey has
already discovered over 500 new pulsars, making it by far the most
successful pulsar survey ever conducted anywhere in the world
(<a href=./gif/mhyst3.gif>Figure 3</a>). 
The PM Survey is expected to double the known population of
radio pulsars when it is completed in the near future.

<p>

The information from the survey is made available soon after a pulsar
is found and its spin parameters are determined. This information,
along with the details and current status of the PM Survey, is
available on the World Wide Web at
<a href=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/pmsurv>http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/pmsurv</a>.

<p>

<h1>Future Developments</h1>

<p>

The plethora of results coming from the PM Survey not only provides a
significant source of information for statistical studies of the
pulsar population, but there are also a number of interesting
individual pulsar systems which have been discovered, including
several unusual and interesting binary systems, a large number of
young pulsars, and two pulsars which which have magnetic field
strengths larger than any previously known radio pulsar. These kinds
of pulsar systems are interesting to study in their own right.

<p>

For instance, one of the pulsars with a record-breaking magnetic field
also has a very long spin period (4 seconds), which suggests that it
might somehow be related to the population of AXPs mentioned above,
which have similar spin properties to this pulsar but emit only X-rays
and no detectable radio emission. The fact that radio emission has
been detected from this pulsar has already been used to rule out a
recently proposed model of the pulsar emission mechanism in which it
was predicted that radio emission should be suppressed in such a high
magnetic field pulsar.

<p>

Continued follow up studies of all of these new discoveries are
underway, and investigation into areas such as the pulsar spin
properties of the sample, their spatial distribution in the Galaxy,
their polarized emission properties, and the interstellar environments
in which these pulsars lie (to name just a few) promises to provide an
array of exciting new scientific results in the near future as the PM
Survey progresses.
